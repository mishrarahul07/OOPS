/*
Operator Overloading is not done for assignment
operator =, +=, -=, *=, /=,%= 

we cannot overload ::,:?,.*, sizeof, . , etc:-

precedence and associativity cannot be changed

arity cannot be changed(cannot make division 
operator unary)

can't create new operators
[], (), -> and the assignment operator(=) must be
declared as member methods

Other operators can be declared as member methods
or global functions.
